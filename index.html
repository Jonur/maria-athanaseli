          <h2>My Story</h2>
        </header>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            I am a Certified Personal Trainer and Pilates Teacher. Soon after
            finishing my studies in Sports Science and Physical Education, I
            completed a Master’s degree in Nutrition and Dietetics. I am very
            passionate about improving overall well-being, through the
            combination of nutrition and exercise. I find what the human body is
            capable of fascinating and it is amazing how it can be transformed
            through physical exercise.
          </p>
          <p>
            A keen swimmer and athlete from childhood, I started ballet classes
            when I was 3 years old and then did rhythmic gymnastics up until the
            start of my undergraduate studies, when I discovered and quickly
            fell in love with Pilates. I hold qualifications across the full
            suite of Pilates equipment, including Mat, Reformer, Tower,
            Cadillac, Wunda Chair, and Ladder Barrel. I have experience working
            in rehabilitation, populations with restrictions and I am
            pre/postnatal certified.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the past 10 years, I have been working at some of Athens’ and
            London’s leading private gym clubs and Pilates studios, while also
            creating bespoke training routines and coaching individuals on how
            to formulate nutrition plans that fit their lifestyle.

          <p>
            &quot;I started working with Maria as a beginner with limited
            abilities a few years ago . since then she helped me build up my
            strength , my posture and increase my mobility. She challenged me to
            try new things and gain confidence while still keeping our sessions
            fun and enjoyable.&quot;<span>Sarah R.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <p>&quot;What can I say - Maria is simply the best! I would say I am a
            challenging client - having started out with no physical fitness at
            all, via some sports injuries and most recently a total knee
            replacement - but whatever new change happens to me, Maria can adapt
            and tailor her PTs to what I need and continue my fitness journey -
            even just a couple of weeks post op!</p><p>When for a variety of reasons,
            I have not been able to work with Maria for a period of time, my
            body knows it and then when I am back for a few sessions, I feel the
            improvement all over.  Right from my very first session in a
            reformer class with Maria, I was made to feel welcome and empowered
            - for someone who had avoided school PE and any form of fitness for
            over 30 years that was no mean feat - and as my fitness has grown (I
            did a half marathon after a couple of years of working with Maria),
            Maria has been able to tailor my programme both with in person
            sessions and more recently during COVID 19 times via Zoom to adapt
            to my progress - knowing exactly how much to push to progress but
            never enough to fail. My sessions with Maria get priority in my busy
            diary now!&quot;<span>Laura M.</span></p>
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Maria is an excellent Pilates teacher and personal trainer and I recommend
            her wholeheartedly. I started working with Maria almost four years ago
            following two back injuries that I suffered in the gym. My back pain reduced
            only after a few weeks of working with Maria and having continued over the
            last four years, I am now stronger, more flexible, leaner and have better
            posture then when I was in my 20s. What makes Maria unique is her
            combination of very strong academic preparation in exercise science and
            physiology, her passion for Pilates, and her ability to transmit that knowledge
            and passion in a very clear and understandable manner. I enjoy working with
            Maria so much that, even though we no longer live in the same country, I still
            see her multiple times a week for online Pilates lessons. I cannot recommend
            Maria highly enough.&quot;<span>Andrew B.</span>
